# Kindness

Kindness is a functional programming framework with a lightweight implementation of higher-kinded types for Swift.

The HKT approach is inspired and influenced by:

* [Lightweight higher-kinded polymorphism](http://ocamllabs.io/higher/lightweight-higher-kinded-polymorphism.pdf) by Jeremy Yallop and Leo White
* [Emulating HKT in Swift](https://gist.github.com/anandabits/f12a77c49fc002cf68a5f1f62a0ac9c4) by Matthew Johnson ([@anandabits](https://www.github.com/anandabits))
* [Superpowered Sequences](https://medium.com/@JLHLonline/superpowered-sequences-a009ccc1ae43) and [A World Beyond Swift Maps](https://medium.com/@JLHLonline/a-world-beyond-swift-maps-f73397d4504) by Jonathan @ Strictly Swift ([@jrsonline](https://github.com/jrsonline))

The protocol hierarchies and conformances are inspired by Haskell and Purescript typeclasses.
